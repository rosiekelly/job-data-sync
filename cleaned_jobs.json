Whether it’s company performance or big-picture economics, you like connecting the dots – and can spot a mismatch or typo.\n\tClear communicator: You know how to break down complicated information and explain it in a way that makes sense – in person, in writing, and over email. You can share your point of view confidently, and you listen well too.\n\tCalm under pressure: Fast-paced? Tight deadlines? No problem. You stay focused, bring positive energy, and don’t let pressure impact your attention to detail.\n\tAlways learning: Markets change all the time, and so do we. You’re curious, adaptable, and always up for learning something new – whether that’s exploring a fresh topic or rethinking the way something’s done.\n\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nFrom day one, you’ll be part of a close-knit team in either equity or macro research – diving deep into specific sectors or economic trends shaping the world. This isn’t just about shadowing; you’ll be contributing to real reports and insights that our clients rely on.\n\n\n\tWork across markets and regions as you help create detailed reports and trade ideas, gaining exposure to different asset classes and global investment themes.\n\tBuild your analytical skills by breaking down complex problems and making sense of numbers, data, and trends – with a sharp eye for detail and accuracy. \n\tExplore how to assess company performance, evaluate risks, and explain what the data means.\n\tLearn how to present with impact, whether that’s in a client meeting, an internal update, or a clear, well-crafted research note.\n\tUnderstand the bigger picture – Learn how the global economy, current events, and market trends influence investment decisions – and how research supports our clients and shapes our big decisions.\n\tTeam up with experienced Analysts and Economists who’ll support your learning, share insights, and help you grow every step of the way.\n\tGet confident using the tools the industry relies on – like financial modelling platforms, data dashboards, and market intelligence tools – so you can turn complex information into clear, compelling insights.\n\n\nYou’ll kick off the programme with a full week of structured training led by external experts. After that, you’ll keep learning on the job – with feedback, mentorship, and plenty of opportunities to stretch yourself. By the end of the internship, you won’t just understand what’s happening in global markets – you’ll have the skills to analyse it, explain it, and act on it. Enjoy your time and perform well, and you’ll have the opportunity of a space on our graduate programme.",

You’ll also collaborate with banking teams across the globe to help find solutions for clients, including corporates, private equity firms, and financial institutions.\n\tExperience different areas of banking – You’ll be placed in either Strategic Advisory, Corporate Finance or Financing Solutions depending on where your interests and our business needs align.\n\tGet exposure to live deals – See how real transactions happen in real time, and get involved in the supporting work that helps make them happen.\n\tBuild your understanding of financial statements – Learn how to read balance sheets, spot anomalies, and calculate key ratios using your accounting knowledge (or develop it with support if you’re new to it).\n\tHelp create client materials – Assist in researching market conditions and preparing documents like investment memos, management presentations, and pitchbooks – the materials we use to support and advise our clients.\n\tExplore how financial models work – Learn how models are used to value businesses, analyse mergers and acquisitions, and assess different types of financing. You’ll start to understand techniques like discounted cash flow and leveraged buyouts.\n\tConduct research and credit analysis – Track what’s happening in the market, dig into company performance, and contribute to the creation of internal insights and client-facing materials.\n\tDevelop your technical toolkit – You’ll sharpen your Excel and PowerPoint skills by building error-free models and putting together polished, client-ready presentations.\n\n\nYou’ll kick off your internship with a week of dedicated training led by external experts.
