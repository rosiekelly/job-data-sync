We work to protect the accuracy and efficiency at every step of the trade.

And finally, Operations confirms that each trade is reported accurately to the buyer, the seller, the firm and the regulators. Along the way, Operations looks for anything that could expose our clients or the firm to financial loss, penalty or other risks. Operations does this for every transaction all around the world. Operations also aids in the design of the technology, the information flows and the processes that make it all work. We constantly monitor these systems and reengineer them to keep everything running as efficiently as possible.",
