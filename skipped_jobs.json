No two Diplomatic and Development Economists fast streamers will share the same career path and you can choose to spend a large part of your career overseas. The unique benefit of this scheme is that the training it provides allows Diplomatic and Development Economists to apply for both analytical economics roles and policy roles later in their career, both within the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) or in other government departments. This offers a great range of career pathways and options for you in the future.\n\n\n\nAll Diplomatic and Development Economist fast streamers must be granted ‘Developed Vetting’ (DV) security clearance before starting. For DV clearance, you need to have lived in the UK for 5 of the last 10 years, including a consecutive 12-month period. Security clearance relies on assurance checks that can only be carried out in the UK – which is why a sufficient UK footprint is a mandatory requirement for this scheme.",
